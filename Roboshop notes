First we need to have Amazon CLI (Command line interface) , We eill be using CLI for automation because we can create intsnces and we can api by CLI from the shell/terminal

Create a instnace by using AMI (Devops-practice) and login into the instance through public ip and create the IAM User and add police (adminstration access)
and open the IAM user created and click security credentials and click create ACCESS KEY ---- Create ACCess key ID and Secret Access key , Because access key id and secret access key were important to connect to amazon cli 

*  open the terminal and connect to the instance created bt using public ip
*  Run the command "aws configuration" to connect to cli
*   Entert access key id* enter secret access key 
*   enter  region 
* leave blank and click enter

\\\To check whether it is connected to AWS or not (Run the commans "aws s3 ls" the output should be empty and or any file ,if its error it is not connected )
